# James Harper tech test

## Instructions

- run `npm install` to install any dependencies
- `npm start` will launch the application. It can be accessed in a browser from `localhost:3000`
- `npm test` will run entire test suite
- `npm run test:watch` will run test suite and watch for any file changes

## Notes
- I was experiencing CORS issues trying to read from the official xkcd API so I ended up using `xkcd.now.sh` instead
